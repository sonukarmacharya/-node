## About Twig specifications - or lack thereof

As incredible as it sounds, Twig is a language with no official specifications - even internally at SensioLabs, [it seems](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/issues/3066#issuecomment-502672166). As such, it is subject to interpretations and twig-lexer is one of them. It's very close to TwigPHP lexer (and as such implements things like [the operator confusion](https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/issues/3066)) but also outputs some token types that are not output by TwigPHP lexer - like `OPENING_QUOTE` or `WHITESPACE` - or with different names - like `TAG_START` instead of `BLOCK_START`.

When (if) official specifications are available, twig-lexer will be updated to match them.
